# Car Sharing

### Description

UPER is a Distributed System that has as main function the sharing of hitchhiking among the people involved in the community of the University of Porto. With this project we intended to implement a platform capable of managing a travel between two points. A registered user who is going to take a trip can create it on the platform and another user could join the trip.

### Functionalities

When starting the application we have the authentication menu, where the user can login or register.
* Create a trip. You create a trip by setting the time and location of departure and destination, as well as the number of seats available.
* Erase a trip. You can delete any of your trips.
* Manage your travels. The user may join or remove passengers who have shown the intention of joining your trip.
* Search for trips. The user can search for travel by entering date, time and place of departure and arrival. 
* List desired trips. In this option, all trips that do not exist but the user wants to perform.
* Join a trip. The user may request to join a trip, approval is always made by its creator.
* Get out of a trip. The user may request to leave a trip.
* My travels. You can list all the trips you have made.
* Wait for a trip. The user could declare the intention to join a trip that does not yet exist. It receives a notification if someone creates a travel that resembles trip's profile. If the user is an administrator, the menu has two more options:
* View all existing trips;
* Delete any of the trips from the application.
